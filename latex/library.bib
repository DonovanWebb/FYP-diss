   abstract = {Measurement-based quantum computation offers exponential computational speed-up through simple measurements on a large entangled cluster state. We propose and demonstrate a scalable scheme for the generation of photonic cluster states suitable for universal measurement-based quantum computation. We exploit temporal multiplexing of squeezed light modes, delay loops, and beam-splitter transformations to deterministically generate a cylindrical cluster state with a two-dimensional (2D) topological structure as required for universal quantum information processing. The generated state consists of more than 30,000 entangled modes arranged in a cylindrical lattice with 24 modes on the circumference, defining the input register, and a length of 1250 modes, defining the computation depth. Our demonstrated source of two-dimensional cluster states can be combined with quantum error correction to enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. Q uantum computing represents a new paradigm for information processing that harnesses the inherent nonclassical features of quantum physics to find solutions to problems that are computation-ally intractable on classical processors (1). In measurement-based, or cluster state, quantum computing (MBQC), the processing is performed by simple single-site measurements on a large entangled cluster state (2). This constitutes a simplification over the standard gate-based model of quantum computing, as it replaces complex coherent unitary dynamics with simple projective measurements. However, one of the outstanding challenges in realizing cluster state computation is the reliable, deterministic, and scalable generation of nonclassical entangled states suitable for universal information processing. Several candidate platforms for scalable cluster state generation have been proposed and some experimentally realized, including solid-state superconducting qubits (3), trapped ion qubits (4, 5), and photonic qubits or qumodes, in which qubits can be encoded, generated by parametric down-conversion (6-9) or by quantum dots (10). However, none of these implementations has demonstrated true scalability combined with computational universality. The largest cluster state generated to date is a temporally multiplexed photonic state comprising entangled modes in a long chain, which, however , does not allow for universal computation because of its one-dimensional (1D) topolo-gical structure (8, 11). To achieve universality, the dimension of the cluster state must be at least two. Several proposals for generating 2D cluster states in different systems have been proposed (12-15), but owing to technical challenges , scalable and computationally universal cluster states have yet to be produced in any physical system. We propose and demonstrate a highly scal-able scheme for the generation of cluster states for universal quantum computation based on quantum continuous variables (CVs) where information is encoded in the position or momentum quadratures of photonic harmonic oscillators (16). We use a temporally multiplexed source of optical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states (17) to generate a long string of entangled modes that is curled up and fused to form a 2D cylindrical array of entangled modes. Specifically , we generate a massive cluster state of more than 30,000 entangled modes comprising an input register of 2 × 12 = 24 modes on which the input state may be encoded, and a length of 1250 modes for encoding operations by projective measurements, limited only by the phase stability of our setup. In addition to being universal and deterministically generated , the source is operated under ambient conditions in optical fibers at the low-loss tele-com wavelength of 1550 nm. These favorable operational conditions and specifications facilitate further upscaling of the entangled state, as well as its use in applications and fundamental studies. The canonical approach to CV cluster state generation is to apply two-mode controlled-Z gates onto pairs of individually prepared eigen-states of the momentum (or phase quadrature) operators ^ p i ; ^ p j in adjacent modes i, j. The gate is described by the unitary operation ^ C Z ¼ e ig^ xi ^ x j , where ^ x i ; ^ x j are the position (ampli-tude quadrature) operators of mode i and j, and g is the interaction strength. Applying this gate to two modes leads to entanglement in the form of quantum correlations of the two modes' quadratures. The operations and resulting state can be represented by a graph in which the nodes represent the momentum eigenstates and the edges (links) between the nodes represent the application of a controlled-Z operation, where the interaction strength is given by the edge weight. In a practical implementation , the unphysical momentum eigen-states are replaced by highly squeezed states, while the controlled-Z operations can be imitated by phase shifts and beam-splitter transformations. To enable scalability, it has been suggested that multiplexing of spatial modes (18), frequency modes (19, 20), or temporal modes (13, 21) be used. For example, Menicucci suggested using temporal multiplexing to form a 2D cluster state combining four squeezed state generators, five beam splitters, and two delay lines (13). We propose a simpler approach to 2D cluster state generation that lowers the experimental requirements (Fig. 1). The state is produced in four steps: (i) Pairs of squeezed vacuum states are generated at 1550-nm wavelength from two bowtie-shaped optical parametric oscilla-tors (OPOs) by parametric down conversion (22). The states are defined in consecutive temporal modes of duration t of the continuously generated OPO output. (ii) The squeezed vacuum pairs in spatial modes A and B are interfered on a balanced beam splitter (denoted BS 1). This produces a train of pairwise EPR-entangled temporal modes that exhibit quantum correlation between the position and momentum quadra-tures. Each EPR pair can be represented by a simple graph of a single edge connecting two nodes. (iii) A 1D cluster state is formed by delaying one arm of the interferometer by t with respect to the other arm and interfering the resulting time-synchronized modes on another balanced beam splitter (denoted BS 2). The interference entangles EPR pairs along an indefinitely long chain, creating a 1D graph. (iv) In the final step, the 2D cluster state is produced by introducing another delay to one interfero-meter arm of duration Nt and interfering the resulting time-synchronized modes on a final beam splitter (denoted BS 3). This effectively curls up the graph and fuses the modes into an indefinitely long cylinder with N nodes on the circumference, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for N = 12, leading to 2 × N = 24 input modes distributed on the two spatial modes A and B. For a detailed description of experimental implementations , see material and methods (23). All states and operations involved are Gaussian, meaning they can be described by Gaussian distributions of the quadrature variables in phase space. In the formalism of graphical calculus for Gaussian states (24), the generated graphs are so-called H-graphs, as they can be generated from vacuum by a single Hamiltonian and have an edge weight of g = i sinh(2r)G, where r is the squeezing parameter of the two squeezing operations and G ¼ À1 for the EPR states, T1=2 for the 1D graph, and T1=4; 1=2 for the 2D graph.

   abstract = {Photons have been a flagship system for studying quantum mechanics, advancing quantum information science, and developing quantum technologies. Quantum entanglement, teleportation, quantum key distribution, and early quantum computing demonstrations were pioneered in this technology because photons represent a naturally mobile and low-noise system with quantum-limited detection readily available. The quantum states of individual photons can be manipulated with very high precision using interferometry, an experimental staple that has been under continuous development since the 19th century. The complexity of photonic quantum computing devices and protocol realizations has raced ahead as both underlying technologies and theoretical schemes have continued to develop. Today, photonic quantum computing represents an exciting path to medium- and large-scale processing. It promises to put aside its reputation for requiring excessive resource overheads due to inefficient two-qubit gates. Instead, the ability to generate large numbers of photons - and the development of integrated platforms, improved sources and detectors, novel noise-tolerant theoretical approaches, and more - have solidified it as a leading contender for both quantum information processing and quantum networking. Our concise review provides a flyover of some key aspects of the field, with a focus on experiment. Apart from being a short and accessible introduction, its many references to in-depth articles and longer specialist reviews serve as a launching point for deeper study of the field.},

Quantum computers, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination.

@report{Walther2005,
   abstract = {Standard quantum computation is based on sequences of unitary quantum logic gates that process qubits. The one-way quantum computer proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel is entirely different. It has changed our understanding of the requirements for quantum computation and more generally how we think about quantum physics. This new model requires qubits to be initialized in a highly entangled cluster state. From this point, the quantum computation proceeds by a sequence of single-qubit measurements with classical feedforward of their outcomes. Because of the essential role of measurement, a one-way quantum computer is irreversible. In the one-way quantum computer, the order and choices of measurements determine the algorithm computed. We have experimentally realized four-qubit cluster states encoded into the polarization state of four photons. We characterize the quantum state fully by implementing experimental four-qubit quantum state tomography. Using this cluster state, we demonstrate the feasibility of one-way quantum computing through a universal set of one-and two-qubit operations. Finally, our implementation of Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that one-way quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks. The quantum computer 1,2 is a powerful application of the laws of quantum physics. Such a device will be far more efficient at factoring 3 or database searches 4 compared to its classical counterparts 5. Considerable effort has been directed towards understanding the role of measurement and entanglement in quantum computation 6-12. A significant step forward in our understanding was the introduction of the one-way quantum computer 13-17 , which highlights the importance of both measurement and entanglement in a striking way. In this model, all of the entanglement is provided in advance through a highly entangled multiparticle cluster state 13. The quantum computation on the cluster state proceeds via local, single-qubit projective measurements with the outcomes potentially affecting those measurement settings that follow. It is a strength of the cluster state model that the intrinsic randomness of quantum measurement results creates specific types of errors that can be corrected through this classical feedforward. Most importantly , feedforward makes cluster state quantum computation deterministic. In the present proof-of-principle experiment, we perform measurements using fixed single-port polarizers, making our computations probabilistic. Different algorithms require only a different pattern of adapted single-qubit operations on a sufficiently large cluster state. As it is entirely based on single-particle measurements instead of unitary evolution, the computation is inherently not time-reversible-it is one-way. Most importantly, cluster state quantum computation is universal 14,17 in that any quantum circuit can be implemented on a suitable cluster state. Open theoretical questions remain about the scalability under realistic noise conditions required for fault-tolerant one-way quantum computation. Although a threshold has been proved to exist 18 , it is unknown whether cluster state quantum computation will be more or less sensitive to noise than the standard model. The one-way quantum computer does not perform quantum logic on the individual qubits of the cluster state. In order to describe the computational circuit, we need to distinguish between the physical qubits (in our case, the polarization state of photons), which make up the cluster state and on which actual measurements are carried out, and encoded qubits, on which the computation is actually taking place. Owing to the specific entanglement of the cluster state, no individual physical qubit carries any information about an input state. Instead, each encoded qubit is written on the cluster state non-locally; that is, the information is carried by the correlations between the physical qubits. As the quantum computation proceeds, the encoded input qubits are processed in the imprinted circuit, whose output is finally transferred onto physical readout qubits. Interestingly, whereas the entanglement between the physical qubits in general decreases as a result of the measurement sequence, the entanglement between encoded qubits may increase. A cluster state can be thought of as emerging from an array of equally prepared independent qubits, which then interact via controlled-phase ('CPhase') gates with their nearest (connected) neighbours. Specifically, a cluster state can be built up as follows: a large number of physical qubits are each prepared in the super-position state j þ l ¼ j0l þ j1l À Á = ffiffi ffi 2 p , where j0l and j1l are the computational basis of the physical qubits. A CPhase operation jjljkl ! ð21Þ jk jjljkl, with (j,k [ 0,1), is then applied between pairs of neighbouring, connected qubits and effectively generates entan-glement between them. The choice of which physical qubit neighbours are entangled by the CPhase operations, drawn as connecting 'bonds' (Fig. 1), determines the structure of the cluster state, which defines the basic type quantum circuit it can implement. This construction provides an intuitive understanding of the graphical representation of cluster states as connected arrays of physical qubits, in which each line corresponds to a previous nearest-neighbour interaction. We will later demonstrate how the highly entangled cluster states can be generated in a different way-directly from nonlinear optical processes. Given a cluster state, two basic types of single-particle measurements suffice to operate the one-way quantum computer. Measurements in the computational basis j0l j ; j1l j È É have the effect of disentangling, that is, removing, the physical qubit j from the articles NATURE | VOL 434 | 10 MARCH 2005 | www.nature.com/nature 169},

   abstract = {This is a short overview explaining how building a large-scale, silicon-photonic quantum computer has been reduced to the creation of good sources of 3-photon entangled states (and may simplify further). Given such sources, each photon needs to pass through a small, constant, number of components, interfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current photonics engineering has already demonstrated the manufacture of thousands of components on two-dimensional semiconductor chips with performance that, once scaled up, allows the creation of tens of thousands of photons entangled in a state universal for quantum computation. At present the fully integrated, silicon-photonic architecture we envisage involves creating the required entangled states by starting with single-photons produced non-deterministically by pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities) combined with on-chip filters and nanowire superconducting detectors to herald that a photon has been produced. These sources are multiplexed into being near-deterministic, and the single photons then passed through an interferometer to non-deterministically produce small entangled states - necessarily multiplexed to near-determinism again. This is followed by a "ballistic" scattering of the small-scale entangled photons through an interferometer such that some photons are detected, leaving the remainder in a large-scale entangled state which is provably universal for quantum computing implemented by single-photon measurements. There are a large number of questions regarding the optimum ways to make and use the final cluster state, dealing with static imperfections, constructing the initial entangled photon sources and so on, that need to be investigated before we can aim for millions of qubits capable of billions of computational time steps. The focus in this article is on the theoretical side of such questions.},

   abstract = {A few decades ago, quantum optics stood out as a new domain of physics by exhibiting states of light with no classical equivalent. The first investigations concerned single photons, squeezed states, twin beams, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states, which involve only one or two modes of the electromagnetic field. The study of the properties of quantum light then evolved in the direction of more and more complex and rich situations, involving many modes of the spatial, temporal, frequency, or polarization type. Actually, each mode of the electromagnetic field can be considered as an individual quantum degree of freedom. It is then possible, using the techniques of nonlinear optics, to couple different modes and thus build in a controlled way a quantum network [H. Jeff Kimble, Nature (London) 453, 1023 (2008)NATUAS0028-083610.1038/nature07127] in which the nodes are optical modes, and that is endowed with a strong multipartite entanglement. In addition, such networks can be easily reconfigurable and are subject only to weak decoherence. They indeed open many promising perspectives for optical communications and computation. Because of the linearity of Maxwell equations a linear superposition of two modes is another mode. This means that a "modal superposition principle"exists hand in hand with the regular quantum state superposition principle. The purpose of this review is to show the interest of considering these two aspects of multimode quantum light in a global way. Indeed, using different sets of modes allows one to consider the same quantum state under different perspectives: A given state can be entangled in one basis and factorized in another. It is shown that there exist some properties that are invariant over a change in the choice of the basis of modes. The method of finding the minimal set of modes that are needed to describe a given multimode quantum state is also presented. It is then shown how to produce, characterize, tailor, and use multimode quantum light while also considering the effect of loss and amplification on such light and the modal aspects of the two-photon coincidences. Switching to applications to quantum technologies, this review shows that it is possible to find not only quantum states that are likely to improve parameter estimation but also the optimal modes in which these states "live."Finally, details on how to use such quantum modal networks for measurement-based quantum computation are presented.},

   abstract = {Entanglement is the key resource for measurement-based quantum computing. It is stored in quantum states known as cluster states, which are prepared offline and enable quantum computing by means of purely local measurements. Universal quantum computing requires cluster states that are both large and possess (at least) a two-dimensional topology. Continuous-variable cluster states-based on bosonic modes rather than qubits-have previously been generated on a scale exceeding one million modes, but only in one dimension. Here, we report generation of a large-scale two-dimensional continuous-variable cluster state. Its structure consists of a 5-by 1240-site square lattice that was tailored to our highly scalable time-multiplexed experimental platform. It is compatible with Bosonic error-correcting codes that, with higher squeezing, enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. Q uantum computers promise applications beyond what is possible with their classical counterparts (1). Recent work has produced advances in quantum computing with stationary matter qubits such as superconducting systems (2), ion trap systems (3), and silicon-based systems (4). With access to both high-quality qubits and high-fidelity quantum gates, it is thus believed that a small-scale quantum computer is within reach. In order to bring these platforms to the scale at which they become useful, efforts [for example, (5)] have been made to address the difficulties of preparing, interfacing, addressing, and tuning large numbers of qubits. However, a technological leap will be necessary to achieve a scalable quantum computer along these lines. In the light of this, we sought a more direct path to scalability. Rather than sequentially preparing and interfacing qubits, one can prepare a large-scale quantum resource state whose constituent quantum systems (such as qubits or modes) are interconnected in advance. Provided that this resource-known as a cluster state (6)-has the required structure and scale, then quantum computing can proceed by means of purely local (single-site) quantum measurements. This paradigm is known as measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) (7, 8). The scale of the cluster state typically determines the number of possible computational steps. Its structure-codified as a graph that describes the entanglement properties of the state-determines which logic gates can be implemented with local measurements. For example, a cluster state corresponding to multiple disjoint one-dimensional (1D) graphs (Fig. 1A) can be used to implement multistep computations, with teleportation along the length of the cluster state being analogous to time evolution along a single circuit wire. However , the absence of connections between wires makes this state incapable of generating en-tanglement between inputs on separate wires, and hence, this resource is insufficient for universal quantum computing. A 2D square lattice graph (Fig. 1B) possesses connectivity in two directions, allowing for time evolution through teleportation in one direction and the multi-input unitary evolution (that generates entanglement) between inputs through connections in the other direction. It enables universal quantum computing by means of local measurements and hence is a universal resource state for MBQC. Finding a universal resource state that is experimentally feasible (so that it can be generated on a large scale) is therefore of paramount importance to the development of a universal measurement-based quantum computer. Cluster states based on bosonic modes-known as continuous-variable cluster states (8)-can be generated deterministically by using compact quantum optics experiments (9). Despite several theoretical proposals for generating universal continuous-variable cluster states [for example, (9-12)], until now the current state-of-the-art experimental demonstrations have been limited to either small-scale (few-system) cluster states (13) or to the generation of large-scale 1D cluster states, which are insufficient for multi-input MBQC (14-16). Generation of even moderately sized 2D cluster states by using discrete variables (qubits) has also never been reported. In this work, we report the generation of a large-scale universal continuous-variable cluster state. The scalability of our experimental method stems from using a time-domain multiplexing (TDM) architecture for continuous-variable (CV) optical systems (9). Optical CV quantum information is encoded within continuous-valued quadratures ^ x k and ^ p k that satisfy ½^ x j ; ^ p k  ¼ iℏd jk and correspond to the complex electric field amplitudes of optical modes residing in temporally localized wave packets. An unlimited number of modes can be continuously and deterministically prepared from a few sources and then transformed into a continuous-variable cluster state through the repeated use of a circuit made of only a small number of optical components. Entan-glement in the resulting state can be observed from correlations in quadrature values of different temporal modes. In this way, we generate and verify a universal cluster state with a 5-by 1240-site 2D square lattice structure, with the possibility of further extension along both lattice dimensions by several orders of magnitude in the near future by use of current technology. Our method generates a continuous-variable cluster state from four squeezed light sources and a linear optical network consisting of five beam splitters and two delay lines (Fig. 1C). After single-mode squeezed states leave each optical parametric oscillator (OPO), they are converted to two-mode squeezed states by beam splitter 1 and beam splitter 2 and then a four-mode entangled state by beam splitter 3. Next, the delay lines multiplex these in time so that they form a 2D (but still disconnected) grid layout with cylindrical boundary conditions. Last, beam splitter 4 and beam splitter 5 produce additional connections, resulting in a continuous cylindrical structure (Fig. 1D) [as shown for the case in which N = 30]. A more detailed description of this generation procedure can be found in (17), section SM2. The surface of this cylinder consists of sites (macronodes) that are arranged in a 2D square lattice whose temporal modes (micronodes) are connected in a nontrivial way (Fig. 1E). The delay between temporal modes arriving at each detector is set by the shorter delay Dt. The longer delay line NDt controls the circumference length (N sites) of the cylinder. Therefore, our method can generate arbitrarily long 2D cluster states, and only the length of the long delay line needs to be increased to extend the circumferential dimension. One limitation on N is that NDt must be below the coherence time of the light source. Relative to the 1D case (14, 15), generating a 2D cluster state requires a more complex network of beam splitters. This is further complicated by stabilization issues and additional optical},

   abstract = {Photonic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-photon measurements. We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled photons in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled photon is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted photons. In our prototype device, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces strings of hundreds of photons in which the entanglement persists over five sequential photons. The measured process map characterizing the device has a fidelity of 0.81 with that of an ideal device. Further feasible improvements of this device may reduce the resources needed for optical quantum information processing. T he concept of entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics (1) and an essential ingredient of proposals in the emerging technologies of quantum information processing (2, 3), including quantum communication (4, 5) and computation (6, 7). In many cases, these applications require multipartite entanglement, encompassing a large number of quantum bits (qubits). Such entangle-ment is often very fragile and can be adversely affected, or even completely vanish, when one of the qubits interacts with its environment or is lost from the system. A special class of quantum states exhibits a persistence of their multi-partite entanglement (8). The entanglement for this class of states is robust to adverse effects on a subset of the qubits. A prominent example of such a quantum state is a cluster state (8)-a string of mutually entangled qubits. Cluster states serve as an important resource for quantum computing , allowing its implementation solely via single-qubit measurements (9). A photonic implementation of cluster states enjoys many advantages , due to the noninteracting nature of photons that suppresses decoherence effects, as well as the precise single-qubit measurements provided by linear optics technology. Generating cluster states is, however, a formidable task. Previously, cluster states of finite size have been demonstrated in trapped ions (10, 11) and in continuous-variable modes of squeezed light (12). In addition, photonic cluster states have been obtained using frequency down-conversion techniques (13-16). Despite these demonstrations, the quest for obtaining a scalable, determinis-tic source of cluster states is still under way. Here, we use quantum dots (QDs), "artificial atoms," which are on-demand sources of both single photons (17, 18) and entangled photon pairs (19-21), to implement a scheme for deter-ministic generation of long strings of entangled photons in a cluster state (22). We demonstrate a prototype device that produces strings of a few hundred photons in which the entangle-ment persists over five sequential photons. Feasible improvements of the device provide a route for both determinism and scalability. Our implementation thereby forms a building block for future quantum information processing developments such as measurement-based quantum computation and quantum communication. Experimentally realizing a cluster state Our implementation is based on a proposal of Lindner and Rudolph (22) in which repeated timed optical excitations of a confined electron in a single semiconductor QD result in the formation of a cluster state composed of the sequentially emitted single photons. The proposal uses the spin of the electron as a matter spin qubit, whose state is entangled with the polarization of the emitted photon (19, 23-26) resulting from the optical excitation. This excitation can, in principle, be repeated indefinitely, whereas the precessing electron spin acts as an "entangler" and entangles the emitted photons to produce a one-dimensional (1D) cluster state. We present a practical realization of this proposal , in which the QD-confined electron is replaced by a confined dark exciton (DE) (27-29). The DE is a semiconductor two-level system, effectively forming a matter spin qubit [see supplementary materials (SM) section 3 (30)]. The two T2 DE spin projections on the QD symmetry axis ^ z form a basis, jT Zi ¼ jT2i, for the DE space (Fig. 1, A and B). The DE energy eigenstates are jT X i ¼ ðjþZi T j−ZiÞ= ffiffi ffi 2 p , with an energy splitting De 2 corresponding to a preces-sion period of T DE ¼ h=De 2 ≃ 3 nsec (27, 28). In addition to the DE, our experiment uses two states of a biexciton (BiE)-a bound state of two excitons-whose total spin projections on ^ z are either þ3 or −3, with a precession period of T BiE ¼ h=De 3 ≃ 5 nsec. We denote these states by jT3i. The experimental protocol relies on the optical transition rules jþ2i ↔ jþ3i and j−2i ↔ j−3i through right jRi and left jLi hand circularly polarized photons, respectively (27, 28), in direct analogy with the original proposal (22). The energy-level diagram describing the DE, the BiE, and the optical transition rules is schematically summarized in Fig. 1C. An ideal protocol for cluster-state generation Before the protocol begins, the DE is determi-nistically initialized in its higher-energy spin eigenstate jy init DE i ¼ j−X i (31) by a short p-area picosecond pulse (29). A p-area pulse transfers the entire population from one quantum state to another. The protocol, which begins immediately after the initialization, consists of repeated applications of a cycle. The cycle contains three elements: (i) a converting laser p-pulse, resonantly tuned to the DE-BiE optical transition. The pulse is rectilinearly horizontally jHi ¼ ðjRi þ jLiÞ= ffiffi ffi 2 p polarized and coherently converts the DE population to a BiE population; (ii) subsequent ra-diative recombination of this BiE, resulting in a DE in the QD and emission of a photon; and (iii) timed free precession of the DE spin. This cycle can be applied multiple times to generate an entangled multiphoton cluster state. Figure 1D illustrates the above procedure and its equivalent circuit diagram. One full cycle of the protocol is indicated in the circuit diagram by a dashed rectangle. The state generated by the above protocol is revealed by following the evolution of the system during the first three steps after the ini-tialization. In step (i), the horizontally polarized p-area pulse "converts" the DE coherent state into a coherent BiE state: jy BiE i ¼ ðjþ3i − j−3iÞ= ffiffi ffi 2 p. In step (ii), radiative recombination of this BiE results in an entangled state of the emitted photon polarization and the DE spin (28), jy DE−1 i ¼ ðjþZijR 1 i − j−ZjL 1 Þ= ffiffi ffi 2 p , where jR 1 i ðjL 1 iÞ is the first photon right-(left-) hand circular polarization state. The excitation and subsequent photon emission are represented in Fig. 1D by a C ^ NOT gate between the DE and the emitted photon. In step (iii), the DE precesses for 3=4 of a precession period. The precession is represented in Fig. 1D by the single-qubit gate G ^ ¼ expði 3p 4 s ^ x Þ, where s ^ x is the corresponding Pauli matrix. The sequential application of the C ^ NOT and G ^ gates forms one full cycle in our protocol. In the beginning of the next cycle, the DE-photon state is given by jy DE−1 i ¼ ½ðjþZi − ij−ZiÞjR 1 i − ðj−Zi − ij þZiÞjL 1 i=2 ð1Þ RESEARCH 434 28 OCTOBER 2016 • VOL 354 ISSUE 6311 sciencemag.org SCIENCE},

We study the implementation of three quantum algorithms by performing homodyne measurements on a two-dimensional temporal continuous-variable cluster state. We first review the generation of temporal cluster states and the implementation of gates using the measurement-based model. Alongside this we discuss methods to introduce non-Gaussianity into the cluster states. The first algorithm we consider is Gaussian Boson Sampling in which only Gaussian unitaries need to be implemented. Taking into account the fact that input states are also Gaussian, the errors due to the effect of finite squeezing can be corrected, provided a moderate amount of online squeezing is available. This helps to construct a large Gaussian Boson Sampling machine. The second algorithm is the continuous-variable Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial circuit in which one needs to implement non-Gaussian gates, such as the cubic phase gate. We discuss several methods of implementing the cubic phase gate and fit them into the temporal cluster state architecture. The third algorithm is the continuous-variable version of Grover's search algorithm, the main challenge of which is the implementation of the inversion operator. We propose a method to implement the inversion operator by injecting a resource state into a teleportation circuit. The resource state is simulated using the Strawberry Fields quantum software package.},

Experimentally appealing, measurement-based quantum computation requires an entangled resource called a cluster state, with long computations requiring large cluster states. Previously, the largest cluster state consisted of eight photonic qubits or light modes, and the largest multipartite entangled state of any sort involved 14 trapped ions. These implementations involve quantum entities separated in space and, in general, each experimental apparatus is used only once. Here, we circumvent this inherent inefficiency by multiplexing light modes in the time domain. We deterministically generate and fully characterize a continuous-variable cluster state containing more than 10,000 entangled modes. This is, by three orders of magnitude, the largest entangled state created to date. The entangled modes are individually addressable wave packets of light in two beams.

This work proposes a protocol to deterministically generate multidimensional photonic cluster states using a single atom-cavity system and time-delay feedback. The dimensionality of the cluster state increases linearly with the number of time-delay feedback. We firstly give a diagrammatic derivation of the tensor network states, which is valuable in simulating matrix product states and projected entangled pair states generated from sequential photons. Our method also provides a simple way to bridge and analyze the experimental imperfections and the logical errors of the generated states. In this method, we analyze the generated cluster states under realistic experimental conditions and address both one-qubit and two-qubit errors.

   abstract = {The subject of quantum computing brings together ideas from classical information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to summarize not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum information theory. Information can be identified as the most general thing which must propagate from a cause to an effect. It therefore has a fundamentally important role in the science of physics. However, the mathematical treatment of information, especially information processing, is quite recent, dating from the mid-20th century. This has meant that the full significance of information as a basic concept in physics is only now being discovered. This is especially true in quantum mechanics. The theory of quantum information and computing puts this significance on a firm footing, and has led to some profound and exciting new insights into the natural world. Among these are the use of quantum states to permit the secure transmission of classical information (quantum cryptography), the use of quantum entanglement to permit reliable transmission of quantum states (teleportation), the possibility of preserving quantum coherence in the presence of irreversible noise processes (quantum error correction), and the use of controlled quantum evolution for efficient computation (quantum computation). The common theme of all these insights is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational resource. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, this review begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then outlined, and the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum from classical information theory and, arguably, quantum from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are next outlined, including qubits and data compression, quantum gates, the 'no cloning' property and teleportation. Quantum cryptography is briefly sketched. The universal quantum computer (QC) is described, based on the Church-Turing principle and a network model of computation. Algorithms for such a computer are discussed, especially those for finding the period of a function, and searching a random list. Such algorithms prove that a QC of sufficiently precise construction is not only},

Our work has relevance to exotic lens design and to the cloaking of objects from electromagnetic fields.},

   abstract = {Since its inception in 2006, transformation optics has become an established tool to understand and design electromagnetic systems. It provides a geometrical perspective into the properties of light waves without the need for a ray approximation. Most studies have focused on modifying the trajectories of light rays, e.g. beam benders, lenses, invisibility cloaks, etc. In this contribution, we explore transformation optics beyond the manipulation of light trajectories. With a few well-chosen examples, we demonstrate that transformation optics can be used to manipulate electromagnetic fields up to an unprecedented level. In the first example, we introduce an electromagnetic cavity that allows for deep subwavelength confinement of light. The cavity is designed with transformation optics even though the concept of trajectory ceases to have any meaning in a structure as small as this cavity. In the second example, we show that the properties of Cherenkov light emitted in a transformationoptical material can be understood and modified from simple geometric considerations. Finally, we show that optical forces-a quadratic function of the fields-follow the rules of transformation optics too. By applying a folded coordinate transformation to a pair of waveguides, optical forces can be enhanced just as if the waveguides were closer together. With these examples, we open up an entirely new spectrum of devices that can be conceived using transformation optics.},

   abstract = {<p>We review and discuss recent progress in the field of nematic colloids, with an emphasis on possible future applications in photonics. The role of the topology is described, based on experimental manipulations of the topological defects in nematic colloids. The topology of the ordering field in nematics provides the forces between colloidal particles that are unique to these materials. We also discuss recent progress in the new field of active microphotonic devices based on liquid crystals (LCs), where chiral nematic microlasers and tuneable nematic microresonators are just two of the recently discovered examples. We conclude that the combination of topology and microphotonic devices based on LCs provides an interesting platform for future progress in the field of LCs.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Coexistence of order and fluidity in soft matter often mimics that in biology, allowing for complex dynamics and applications-like displays. In active soft matter, emergent order can arise because of such dynamics. Powered by local energy conversion, this behavior resembles motions in living systems, like schooling of fish. Similar dynamics at cellular levels drive biological processes and generate macroscopic work. Inanimate particles capable of such emergent behavior could power nanomachines, but most active systems have biological origins. Here we show that thousands-to-millions of topological solitons, dubbed “skyrmions”, while each converting macroscopically-supplied electric energy, exhibit collective motions along spontaneously-chosen directions uncorrelated with the direction of electric field. Within these “schools” of skyrmions, we uncover polar ordering, reconfigurable multi-skyrmion clustering and large-scale cohesion mediated by out-of-equilibrium elastic interactions. Remarkably, this behavior arises under conditions similar to those in liquid crystal displays and may enable dynamic materials with strong emergent electro-optic responses.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Malleability of metals is an example of how the dynamics of defects like dislocations induced by external stresses alters material properties and enables technological applications. However, these defects move merely to comply with the mechanical forces applied on macroscopic scales, whereas the molecular and atomic building blocks behave like rigid particles. Here, we demonstrate how motions of crystallites and the defects between them can arise within the soft matter medium in an oscillating electric field applied to a chiral liquid crystal with polycrystalline quasi-hexagonal arrangements of self-assembled topological solitons called “torons.” Periodic oscillations of electric field applied perpendicular to the plane of hexagonal lattices prompt repetitive shear-like deformations of the solitons, which synchronize the electrically powered self-shearing directions. The temporal evolution of deformations upon turning voltage on and off is not invariant upon reversal of time, prompting lateral translations of the crystallites of torons within quasi-hexagonal periodically deformed lattices. We probe how these motions depend on voltage and frequency of oscillating field applied in an experimental geometry resembling that of liquid crystal displays. We study the interrelations between synchronized deformations of the soft solitonic particles and their arrays, and the ensuing dynamics and giant number fluctuations mediated by motions of crystallites, five–seven defects pairs, and grain boundaries in the orderly organizations of solitons. We discuss how our findings may lead to technological and fundamental science applications of dynamic self-assemblies of topologically protected but highly deformable particle-like solitons.</p>},

However, producing multidimensional solitary states and manipulation of their motion are still big challenges. In this work, we describe the formation of dynamic multidimensional solitons in a nematic and a cholesteric liquid crystal (LC). These solitons are self-confined director perturbations that propagate rapidly through the LC bulk and preserve their identities after collisions. We tune the velocity of the solitons by electric fields and control their trajectories through alignment layers. We find that the chirality of the cholesteric LC endows the solitons a wave-particle duality, and leads to a variety of fascinating interactions between solitons which cannot be observed in the achiral nematic LC. Furthermore, we also show that these solitons can be used as vehicles for 2D delivery of micro-cargos.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>We discuss the spectral energy distributions and physical properties of six galaxies whose photometric redshifts suggest they lie beyond a redshift z ≃ 9. Each was selected on account of a prominent excess seen in the Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 $\mu$m band which, for a redshift above z = 9.0, likely indicates the presence of a rest-frame Balmer break and a stellar component that formed earlier than a redshift z ≃ 10. In addition to constraining the earlier star formation activity on the basis of fits using stellar population models with BAGPIPES, we have undertaken the necessary, but challenging, follow-up spectroscopy for each candidate using various combinations of Keck/MOSFIRE, VLT/X-shooter, Gemini/FLAMINGOS2, and ALMA. Based on either Lyman-α or [O iii] 88 $\mu$m emission, we determine a convincing redshift of z = 8.78 for GN-z-10-3 and a likely redshift of z = 9.28 for the lensed galaxy MACS0416-JD. For GN-z9-1, we conclude the case remains promising for a source beyond z ≃ 9. Together with earlier spectroscopic data for MACS1149-JD1, our analysis of this enlarged sample provides further support for a cosmic star formation history extending beyond redshifts z ≃ 10. We use our best-fitting stellar population models to reconstruct the past rest-frame UV luminosities of our sources and discuss the implications for tracing earlier progenitors of such systems with the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Infrared and nebular lines provide some of our best probes of the physics regulating the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) at high redshift. However, interpreting the physical conditions of high-redshift galaxies directly from emission lines remains complicated due to inhomogeneities in temperature, density, metallicity, ionization parameter, and spectral hardness. We present a new suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, each centred on a massive Lyman-break galaxy that resolves such properties in an inhomogeneous ISM. Many of the simulated systems exhibit transient but well-defined gaseous discs that appear as velocity gradients in [C ii] 157.6 $\mu$m emission. Spatial and spectral offsets between [C ii] 157.6 $\mu$m and [O iii] 88.33 $\mu$m are common, but not ubiquitous, as each line probes a different phase of the ISM. These systems fall on the local [C ii]–SFR relation, consistent with newer observations that question previously observed [C ii] 157.6 $\mu$m deficits. Our galaxies are consistent with the nebular line properties of observed z ∼ 2–3 galaxies and reproduce offsets on the BPT and mass-excitation diagrams compared to local galaxies due to higher star formation rate (SFR), excitation, and specific-SFR, as well as harder spectra from young, metal-poor binaries. We predict that local calibrations between H α and [O ii] 3727$\, \mathring\{\rm A\}$ luminosity and galaxy SFR apply up to z &gt; 10, as do the local relations between certain strong line diagnostics (R23 and [O iii] 5007$\, \mathring\{\rm A\}$/H β) and galaxy metallicity. Our new simulations are well suited to interpret the observations of line emission from current (ALMA and HST) and upcoming facilities (JWST and ngVLA).</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The observation of quasars at very high redshift such as Pōniuā’ena is a challenge for models of super-massive black hole (SMBH) formation. This work presents a study of SMBH formation via known physical processes in star-burst clusters formed at the onset of the formation of their hosting galaxy. While at the early stages hyper-massive star-burst clusters reach the luminosities of quasars, once their massive stars die, the ensuing gas accretion from the still forming host galaxy compresses its stellar black hole (BH) component to a compact state overcoming heating from the BH–BH binaries such that the cluster collapses, forming a massive SMBH-seed within about a hundred Myr. Within this scenario the SMBH–spheroid correlation emerges near-to-exactly. The highest-redshift quasars may thus be hyper-massive star-burst clusters or young ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs), being the precursors of the SMBHs that form therein within about 200 Myr of the first stars. For spheroid masses ≲ 109.6 M⊙ a SMBH cannot form and instead only the accumulated nuclear cluster remains. The number evolution of the quasar phases with redshift is calculated and the possible problem of missing quasars at very high redshift is raised. SMBH-bearing UCDs and the formation of spheroids are discussed critically in view of the high redshift observations. A possible tension is found between the high star-formation rates (SFRs) implied by downsizing and the observed SFRs, which may be alleviated within the IGIMF theory and if the downsizing times are somewhat longer.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Detections and non-detections of Lyman alpha (Lyα) emission from z &amp;gt; 6 galaxies (&amp;lt;1 Gyr after the big bang) can be used to measure the timeline of cosmic reionization. Of key interest to measuring reionization’s mid-stages, but also increasing observational challenge, are observations at z &amp;gt; 7, where Lyα redshifts to near infra-red wavelengths. Here we present a search for z &amp;gt; 7.2 Lyα emission in 53 intrinsically faint Lyman Break Galaxy candidates, gravitationally lensed by massive galaxy clusters, in the KMOS Lens-Amplified Spectroscopic Survey (KLASS). With integration times of ∼7–10 h, we detect no Lyα emission with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) &amp;gt; 5 in our sample. We determine our observations to be 80 per cent complete for 5σ spatially and spectrally unresolved emission lines with integrated line flux &amp;gt;5.7 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2. We define a photometrically selected sub-sample of 29 targets at z = 7.9 ± 0.6, with a median 5σ Lyα EW limit of 58 Å. We perform a Bayesian inference of the average intergalactic medium (IGM) neutral hydrogen fraction using their spectra. Our inference accounts for the wavelength sensitivity and incomplete redshift coverage of our observations, and the photometric redshift probability distribution of each target. These observations, combined with samples from the literature, enable us to place a lower limit on the average IGM neutral hydrogen fraction of $\gt 0.76 \,\, (68\{\{\ \rm per\ cent\}\}), \,\, \gt 0.46 \,\, (95\{\{\ \rm per\ cent\}\})$ at z ∼ 8, providing further evidence of rapid reionization at z ∼ 6–8. We show that this is consistent with reionization history models extending the galaxy luminosity function to $M_ \rm \{\small UV\}\lesssim -12$, with low ionizing photon escape fractions, $f_\textrm\{esc\} \lesssim 15\{\{\ \rm per\ cent\}\}$.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>It remains a major challenge to derive a theory of cloud-scale ($\lesssim100$ pc) star formation and feedback, describing how galaxies convert gas into stars as a function of the galactic environment. Progress has been hampered by a lack of robust empirical constraints on the giant molecular cloud (GMC) lifecycle. We address this problem by systematically applying a new statistical method for measuring the evolutionary timeline of the GMC lifecycle, star formation, and feedback to a sample of nine nearby disc galaxies, observed as part of the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We measure the spatially resolved (∼100 pc) CO-to-H α flux ratio and find a universal de-correlation between molecular gas and young stars on GMC scales, allowing us to quantify the underlying evolutionary timeline. GMC lifetimes are short, typically $10\!-\!30\,\{\rm Myr\}$, and exhibit environmental variation, between and within galaxies. At kpc-scale molecular gas surface densities $\Sigma _\{\rm H_2\}\ge 8\,\rm \{M_\odot\}\,\{\{\rm pc\}\}^\{-2\}$, the GMC lifetime correlates with time-scales for galactic dynamical processes, whereas at $\Sigma _\{\rm H_2\}\le 8\,\rm \{M_\odot\}\,\{\{\rm pc\}\}^\{-2\}$ GMCs decouple from galactic dynamics and live for an internal dynamical time-scale. After a long inert phase without massive star formation traced by H α (75–90 per cent of the cloud lifetime), GMCs disperse within just $1\!-\!5\,\{\rm Myr\}$ once massive stars emerge. The dispersal is most likely due to early stellar feedback, causing GMCs to achieve integrated star formation efficiencies of 4–10 per cent. These results show that galactic star formation is governed by cloud-scale, environmentally dependent, dynamical processes driving rapid evolutionary cycling. GMCs and H ii regions are the fundamental units undergoing these lifecycles, with mean separations of $100\!-\!300\,\{\{\rm pc\}\}$ in star-forming discs. Future work should characterize the multiscale physics and mass flows driving these lifecycles.</p>},

We show why complex molecules found in high abundance are universal biosignatures and demonstrate the first intrinsic experimentally tractable measure of molecular complexity, called the molecular assembly index (MA). To do this we calculate the complexity of several million molecules and validate that their complexity can be experimentally determined by mass spectrometry. This approach allows us to identify molecular biosignatures from a set of diverse samples from around the world, outer space, and the laboratory, demonstrating it is possible to build a life detection experiment based on MA that could be deployed to extraterrestrial locations, and used as a complexity scale to quantify constraints needed to direct prebiotically plausible processes in the laboratory. Such an approach is vital for finding life elsewhere in the universe or creating de-novo life in the lab.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Recently, artificially constructed metamaterials have become of considerable interest, because these materials can exhibit electromagnetic characteristics unlike those of any conventional materials. Artificial magnetism and negative refractive index are two specific types of behavior that have been demonstrated over the past few years, illustrating the new physics and new applications possible when we expand our view as to what constitutes a material. In this review, we describe recent advances in metamaterials research and discuss the potential that these materials may hold for realizing new and seemingly exotic electromagnetic phenomena.</p>},
