XXPREVIOUSXX
A device capable of uniformly concentrating a magnetic fields inside of
a free space cavity will increase the efficiency of many magnetic
devices and sensors.  This project shall look at a proposed design for
a magnetic field concentrator informed by the transformation optic
technique. A metamaterial shell comprised of high and low permeability
sections alternating in the angular direction has been shown to
approximate the designed concentrator\cite{N2014}. The ability of the shell acting
as a concentrator will be explored in various regimes with a specific
focus on improving efficiency of wireless power transmission.

\section{Introduction}
%% - Motivation and overview brief description of power transfer problem

The manipulation of magnetic fields is a critical tool for many modern
technologies. Magnetic devices often have efficiencies dependent on
the strength of interaction with an external magnetic field. Examples
include energy harvesting from magnetic fields~\cite{HARVESTING} to
brain activity scans by locating small magnetic
gradients~\cite{BRAIN}. These devices may have increased efficiency by
concentrating the desired magnetic field within the area of sensing or
harvesting. \\ Magnetic fields may be described by Maxwell's
equations~\cite{MAXWELL} and are guided by materials due to their
optical properties, such as permitivity and permeability~\cite{OPTICAL
  PROPERITES}. Fermat's principle of least time allowed the design
of many optical devices using geometrical lenses~\cite{FERMAT},
however, with the maturation of fabrication techniques, many materials
may be produced with exotic anisotropic optical properties~\cite{META}
prompting the development of transformation optics (TO) --- a modern
approach to optical device design.\\ Here we describe one such TO
designed device; The magnetic concentrator~\cite{PRATT}, with a particular focus
on its efficacy in wireless power transmission. \\

    transformation $A$ is applied to guide the ray along a desired
    path. c) A material (blue) is insterted into the untransformed
    space with corresponding permeability and permitivity which mimics
    the spatial coordinate transform $A$ for the ray. }
  \label{fig:TO}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Transformation Optics and Metamaterials}
TO informed the design of many new devices such as perfect
lenses~\cite{}, magenetic-hoses~\cite{}, -cloaks~\cite{},
-rotators~\cite{}, -blackholes~\cite{}, and -concentrators~\cite{}. It
can be shown that due to the form invariance of Maxwell's equations, a
spatial coordinate transform is equivalent to the insertion of a
material with specific permeabilities and permitivities. This is shown
conceptually by the three steps of the schematic shown in
figure~\ref{fig:TO}. First a ray is considered in free cartesian space
in panel $a$, which due to Fermat's principle of least time will be
following the horizontal spatial grid lines.  The space is then
transformed arbitrarily in panel $b$ so that the ray adopts the
desired path for the final device. The transformation required, $A$,
to morph the ray now informs the optical properties for the specific
inserted material of panel $c$, which is once again located in
untransformed space.\\ The form invariance of Faraday's law is
described by the equivalent expressions
\begin{equation}
  \label{ME1}
  \nabla'\times \textbf{E'} = -jw[\mu_0]\textbf{H'}
  ~~~~~~~~and~~~~~~~~
  \nabla\times \textbf{E} = -jw[\mu']\textbf{H},
\end{equation}
where the first is expressed in transformed coordinate space $x'(x, y,
z), y'(x, y, z), z'(x, y, z)$ and free space permeability $[\mu_0]$,
whilst the second is expressed in untransformed cartesian space $x, y,
z$ but with some space dependent permeability $[\mu']$.  Equivalent
expressions exist for the remaining Maxwell equations and similarly
some non-free permittivity $[\epsilon']$ is required. The space
dependant permeabilities and permittivities are found by,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:J}
  \mu'=\frac{A\mu_0 A^T}{|A|}
  ~~~~~~~~and~~~~~~~~
  \epsilon'=\frac{A\epsilon_0 A^T}{|A|}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the Jacobian matrix describing the transformation of
coordinate systems (e.g. between panel $a$ and panel $b$ in
figure~\ref{fig:TO}). \\ The resulting calculated optical properties
may be anisotropic, have arbitrary magnitude and even be
negative~\cite{}. As bulk materials rarely, if ever, show these
properties, optical metamaterials are often
required~\cite{META3}. \\ Metamaterials are often comprised of
repeating units whose dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength
of the interacting radiation~\cite{META2}. The individual units may
have specific geometery, orientation and optical properties to
selectively interact with incident waves so that the net effect of the
material mimics a bulk substance with different optical properties
than its substituent parts.\\

\subsection{Magnetic Concentrator}
As described above, a device capable of magnetic field concentration
can increase the efficiency of sensors and energy harvesters.
Utilising TO we may design an optimal field concentrator which fulfils
the criteria: The magnetic field within a region $A$ is concentrated
into a cavity $B$ where $B$ is free space only. A possible geometry
for this device that has cylindrical symmetry is shown on LHS of
figure~\ref{fig:d_motiv}.  To satisy these conditions two coordinate
transforms are applied: First the region $\rho < R_2 - \eta$ is
radially and linearly compressed to the region $\rho < R_1$; Second,
to ensure the continuity of our transformed space, a high ($k^{th}$)
order polynomial radial expansion of $R_2 - \eta < \rho < R_2$ to the
region $R_1 < \rho < R_2$ is made. These transformations are described
by the coordinate transformations,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:transform}
  \begin{split}
\rho' = \frac{R_1}{R_2-\xi}\rho,~~~~~~~~\rho'\in[0,~R_2-\xi)~~\\
\rho' = R_2^{1-k}\rho^k~~~~~~~~~\rho'\in[R_2-\xi,~R_2).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
By symmetry we see that $\theta$ and $z$ remain unchanged through the
two transformations. The corresponding Jacobians may be found for
these transformations and using equation~\ref{eqn:J}, the
permeabilities of the required inserted material may be found to be
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:mat}
  \begin{split}
 \mu' = \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&(\frac{R_2-\xi}{R_1})^2\end{pmatrix}~~~~~~~~~~~~~\rho'\in[0,~R_1)~~\\
~~~~~~\mu' = \begin{pmatrix}k&0&0\\0&1/k&0\\0&0&\frac{1}{k}(\frac{\rho'}{R_2})^{2/k-2}\end{pmatrix}~~~~~\rho'\in[R_1,~R_2)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Taking the limit $\eta \rightarrow 0$ in order to concentrate all of
the field within $A$ into $B$, and matching the boundary conditions at
$R_2-\eta$ and at $R1$, we find that $k \rightarrow \infty$. From this
we find that the required permeability within $B$ is satisfied by free
space whilst a material with radial permeability $\mu_\rho \rightarrow
\infty$ and angular permeability $\mu_\theta \rightarrow 0$ is
required for region $A$. The $z$ components of permeability are ignored
as we assume the cyclindrical shell is
infinitely long so the $z$ component must be invariant. A model for
this theoretical shell can be seen guiding an external magnetic field
in the COMSOL simulation (figure~\ref{fig:COMSOL}~$a$).\\ To satisfy
these highly anisotropic conditions practically, an exploration of
metamaterials is required. A possible discretized shell construction
is proposed~\cite{PRATT} where the high radial permeability is
provided by ferromagnetic materials whilst the angular permeability is
shielded by superconducting material. Materials such as MuMetal, have
relative permeabilities of up to $300,000+$~\cite{MUMETAL} and ideal
superconductors in their Meissner state will exclude all magenetic
fields from within their interior giving a relative permeability of
$0$~\cite{Meissner}. In an alternating field, a far cheaper option for
blocking the angular magnetic field component is the use of copper
sheeting. From Lenz's law an oscillating magnetic field perpendicular
to a metal sheet will induce Eddy currents which will oppose the
changing field. At an appropriate frequency, which is proportional to
the copper thickness, the effective angular permeability is reduced to
near zero. To approximate the conditions proposed by TO design, these
two materials may be arranged in alternating angular sheets, as seen
in figure~\ref{fig:shells}. \\ In an external static uniform magnetic
field, the ideal shell will increase the field within region $B$ by a
factor of $R_2/R_1$. Similarly if a magnetic dipole is surrounded by
the concentrating shell, then the field outside of the shell will be
increased by a factor of $R_2/R_1$. \\

%% within their bulk~\cite{ferro} however, concentration of the field

\subsection{Wireless Power Transfer}

The ability to transfer power between devices that are not connected
by wires is useful in many settings: for convenince, e.g. mobile
phones; for safety, e.g. implanted medical devices; or for
practicallity, e.g. satellites. We shall focus on near field power
transmission by the use of inductive coupling. Inductive coupling
transfers power between two coils of wire (two inductors) by an
oscillating magnetic field.  The transmitting coil is supplied with an
alternating current, which by Ampere's law creates an oscillating
magnetic field. The receiving coil is placed within this magnetic
field so that a current is induced as described by Faraday's law. A
schematic of these two coupled circuits can be seen in
figure~\ref{fig:WPT}~$a, b,$ and $d$. This strategy for power transfer
is highly sensitive to distance as the magnetic field of a dipole
drops off with distance cubed, $r^{-3}$, therefore the power is
proportional to $r^{-6}$ if the dipole is driven at a fixed frequency
and current.  The power transfer efficiency, PTE, also suffers with
distance as the non-ideal resistive losses in the primary coil remain
(relatively) constant with distance. To somewhat counteract this sharp
drop off of efficiency with distance, concentrating shells may be used
to magnify the transmitted field and locally concentrate the field
around the receiving solenoid. The concentrating shell is larger than
the coil by necessity, however the presence of a shell is always
advantageous when the free space distance between the power
transmitting and power receiving device is greater than $k$, where
\begin{equation}
k = \frac{R_2}{\sqrt[3]{R}-1}
\end{equation}
and $R$ is the ratio $R_2/R_1$. This arrangement and the critical
distance $k$ is shown in figure~\ref{fig:d_motiv}.\\

\end{figure}

\subsection{Construction of shell}
$0.15$~mm MuMetal (MSFHP from Thorlabs) and $0.3$~mm copper were cut
into $21$~mm by $30$~mm rectangular sheets.  Plastic supports for
holding $36$ sheets of either MuMetal or copper were 3D printed to
produce the shells seen in figure~\ref{fig:shells}. The inner radius
$R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$ were $7$ and $21$~mm respectively to give
an $R_2/R_1$ ratio of 4. The ``Full shell'' contains $36$ sheets of
alternating copper and MuMetal, whilst the ``No shell'' scenario
contains no metal. \\

\subsection{DC Magnetic Fields}
Helmholtz coils (figure~\ref{fig:shells}) were powered by a constant
DC current to create a uniform magnetic field, $B$, within their
center described by
\begin{equation}
  B = \frac{8}{5\sqrt{5}}\frac{\mu_0 nI}{R},
  \label{eqn:helm}
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the radius of the coils, $I$ is the current supplied to
the coils, and $n$ is the number of turns of wire.  A Hall probe
placed at the center of the Helmholtz coils will have a Hall voltage
induced which is proportional to the magnetic field. Once calibrated
the Hall probe can be used to measure the absolute value of the
magnetic field present. A concentrating shell may now be placed 
at the center of the Helmholtz coils and the Hall probe placed within
the $R_1$ section of the shells to explore field concentration.

%%  This equation follows directly from the Biot-Savart law
%% \cite{XXX} and the relative geometry of the coils as seen in
%% figure~\ref{fig:helm}. From equation~\ref{eqn:helm} it can be seen that
%% the magnetic field should increase linearly with supplied
%% current. Using the Hall probe we ensured this was the case and found
%% the relationship of current supplied to magnetic field produced for
%% our paticular Helmholtz arrangement.\\ Now, with the capability to
%% produce known external magnetic fields, the described field
%% concentrating shells may be placed within this field and the Hall
%% probe may be placed within their inner radius to measure concentrated
%% field.

%% \subsection{AC characterization}

%% Use of solenoid, limitations due to pick up.\\
%% Due to the induced voltage across the inductor being small and
%% background noise being high, a lock-in amplifier was used to select
%% only the desired signal frequency. This substantially reduced noise in
%% our readings allowing higher frequency and lower magnetic field
%% strength experiments.\\

\subsection{Power Transfer}
Power transfer experiments measure power dropped across a load
resistor in a receiving circuit versus power lost in the transmitting
circuit's inductor. The receiving circuit, seen in
figure~\ref{fig:WPT}, has multiple arrangements to optimise power
transfer, the simplest of which is the load resistor in series with
the receiving inductor forming an RL circuit. Assuming the non-ideal
real resistances of the coil is $r_2 << \omega L$, then the optimal
load resistance for power transfer at some frequency $\omega$ is found
by,
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.4\linewidth}
\begin{equation}
  V_2 = I_2 (j\omega L_2 + R),  
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  P_R = |I_2|^2R = \frac{V_2^2R}{\omega^2L_2^2 + R^2},
\end{equation}
\end{minipage}
~~
\vrule
\begin{minipage}{0.4\linewidth}
  $$\text{and setting\quad} \frac{dP_R}{dR} = 0,$$ 
\begin{equation}
  \Rightarrow R = \omega L_2.
  \label{eqn:RL-max}
\end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
The EMF induced in the receiving coil of a coupled inductance system
may be found by Faraday's law,
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon = -\frac{d\phi_{21}}{dt},~~~\text{or}~~~\varepsilon = -M\frac{dI_{1}}{dt},
  \label{eqn:M}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{21}$ is the magnetic flux through coil 2 due to the
current of coil 1 and $M$ is the equivalent mutual inductance between
two coils.
%% \begin{equation}
%%   M = \frac{\phi_{21}}{I_1},
%% \end{equation}
If the current in coil 1 is alternating sinuisoidally, then the
maximum EMF induced in coil 2 will be $M I_1 \omega$. Changes in
mutual inductance for different shell constructions is a useful metric
for field concentration as it is proportional to the magnetic flux
present in coil 2. It may also be readily calculated if the current in
coil one is known and the voltage across the load resistance in
circuit 2 is measured at the optimal load resistance
(equation~\ref{eqn:RL-max}). This simple relationship of voltage
measurement $V_2$ to mutual inductance $M$ is described by,
\begin{equation}
  V_2 = \frac{MI_1\omega}{\sqrt{2}}.
\label{eqn:MVs}
\end{equation}

%XXX
Parallel RLC coupled to coil can be considered as
figure~\ref{fig:RLC-eqcirc}.  The voltage across $R_{load}$ is equal
to,
$$ V_s = j\omega MI_p - j\omega L_sI_s.$$
$I_s$ can be found by,
$$ I_s = j\omega MI_p / z_s $$
where $z_s$ is the total impedance of circuit 2...
\begin{equation}
V_s = \frac{MR}{L_s}I_p.
\label{eqn:RLC-M}
\end{equation}
Therefore a plot of $V_s / R$ against $I_p$ will yield a gradient of
$M/L_s$ as seen in figure~\ref{fig:RLC-IvI}.  Furthermore, $M =
M(\omega)$ for shells with copper present, and so a plot of
$(M/L_s)/(M^0/L_s^0)$ gives the relative increase in $M/L_s$ with
frequency as seen in figure~\ref{fig:RLC-Mrel}.\\


To maximise power transfer an RLC circuit is constructed on the
receiving circuit. Ideally in an RLC circuit the complex impedance of
the inductance and capacitance cancel leaving only the load
resistance. Our inductance is set by the solenoid we chose to use and
so for exploring power transfer at various frequencies, a capacitance
can be found to satisfy the resonance condition. If inductance, $L$,
does not vary then capacitance, $C$, is easily found by,
\begin{equation}
  C = \frac{1}{w^2L}.
\end{equation}
However, we need not assume that inductance is constant. A series RLC
circuit can be constructed as seen in figure~\ref{fig:WPT}~$c$ to
ensure resonance is met. Resonance occurs in this circuit when $V_x$
is exactly in phase with $V_y$. In this case any imaginary impedances
are cancelled and only real resistance remains. \\ For maximal power
transfer a parallel RLC circuit is preferable however due to the
restraints of the experiement a non-ideal version must be made as seen
in figure~\ref{fig:WPT}~$b$. The resonant condition found by the
series RLC is a close approximation to this more complicated parallel
circuit. \\
To maximise power transfer in the series RLC case, a familiar idea of
impedance matching occurs, i.e. Power is maximised when the load
resistance is equal to any internal resistances of the
components~\cite{XXX}. As internal resistances are difficult to
measure and may depend on current XXX, this could also be found
experimentally by measuring voltage and current over the load
resistance whilst varying load resistance. \\ For the parallel RLC
case, a more complicated expression for optimal load resistance was
found which depends non trivially on a combination of internal
resistances. A model is proposed below, however, experimentally
locating the optimal resistances was chosen as measuring internal
resistances proved difficult and time consuming.\\

Using Helmholtz coils powered in DC to create a static external
magnetic field (see Methods), we observed constant field concentration
factors within the $R_1$ cavity for various shell constructions. No
shell, 18 MuMetal, and 36 MuMetal shells were used and their
concentration factor with field may be seen in
figure~\ref{fig:DC_RL}$a$, where concentration factor, $C$, is defined
as (Magnetic field within shell's cavity)/(external field produced by
Helmholtz coils). It was found that the shell construction of $36$
MuMetal thin sheets gave the optimum concentration factor of $C_{36} =
(2.43\pm0.04)$ with errors likely due to the sensitivity of dipole
orientation within the field. The $18$ MuMetal shell gave a magnetic
concentration factor of $C_{18} = (2.31\pm0.04)$, which suggests that
the shell behaves more ideally with a greater number of
sheets. Simulation work performed on COMSOL further supports this
difference between $18$ and $36$ MuMetal sheets as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:COMSOL}~$e$. The absolute values predicted by COMSOL,
$C_{18}= (2.32\pm0.01)$ and $C_{36} = (2.46\pm0.02)$, closely match
the experimentally observed concentration factors for both cases.

Power is transferred from the primary circuit to a load resistor in
the secondary circuit in a coupled inductive arrangement as explained
in Methods. This may be simply performed by placing a load resistor in
parallel with the receiving inductor $L_2$ forming an RL circuit as
seen in figure~\ref{fig:WPT}~$a$. To maximise power transferred, the
optimal load resistance was matched to $R = \omega L$ (see Methods
equation~\ref{eqn:RL-max}). Figure~\ref{fig:DC_RL}~$b$ shows the
relative PTE versus load resistance for various frequencies confirming
the expected optimum load resistance. \\ Mutual inductances between
the coils at a set distance of $59$~mm were found by measuring the
voltage across the load resistor in the secondary RL circuit and the
current driving the primary circuit and using
equation~\ref{eqn:MVs}. The copper only, MuMetal only, and full copper
plus MuMetal shells all showed a concentrating effect by their
relative increases in mutual inductance between the two coils as shown
in figure~\ref{fig:DC_RL}~$c$. The full shell showed an increase of
mutual inductance (magnetic field) by a factor of $(3.0\pm0.1)$, which
is nearing the theoretical result from TO of $R_2/R_1 = 4$ despite
only containing $36$ sheets. The frequency dependance on the relative
increase in mutual inductance is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:DC_RL}~$d$. The two shell configurations containing
copper are shown to have concentrating effects dependant on
frequency. The concentrating effect rises steeply within the first
$10$~kHz and then plateaus for high frequencies.  This expected
behaviour initially motivated the choice for copper sheets in the
shells for AC power transfer. At higher frequencies the perpendicular
component of alternating magnetic fields produce eddy currents within
the copper which, due to Lenz's law, oppose the change of field
direction and effectively increases the angular permeability of the
shell.  Supporting work done on COMSOL (figure~\ref{fig:COMSOL}~$b-e$)
shows a similar observed effect where $36$ copper sheets increases the
concentration factor rapidly from $C = 1$ at $0$~Hz to $C \approx 1.5$
by $10$~kHz and then only a small further increase in efficacy at
higher frequencies.\\ Apart from errors due to instrument, measurement
reading, and coil placement, we observed noise due to stray magnetic
fields inducing pick-up within cables connecting the solenoid to the
lock-in amplifier. This source of noise is highly frequency dependent
and is at the same frequency as our desired signal, so could not be
removed by the use of a lock-in amplifier. To supress this noise
careful cable placement and shielding was installed. \\

Parallel RLC circuits are more fitting for optimising power
transfer~\cite{XXX} as explained in Methods. For the arrangement
described in figure~\ref{fig:WPT}~$b$, a full shell comprised of $18$
MuMetal and $18$ copper sheets was explored. The optimal load
resistances were found experimentally by measuring power for a sweep
of resistances, an example of which is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:cpdRLC}~$a$ for a field frequency of $30$~kHz.\\
From equation~\ref{eqn:RLC-M} the voltage measured across the load
resistor is proportional to the mutual inductance between the two
coils when the optimal load resistor is used and the resonance
condition for the RLC circuit is met. Figure~\ref{fig:cpdRLC}~$b$
confirms this relationship and shows an increase of mutual inductance
when the full concentrating shell is present. The gradient was found
to be increased by a factor of $(2.6 \pm 0.2)$ corresponding to a field
concentration of the same factor if the inductance of $L_2$ is assumed
to remain constant. \\
The frequency dependance on concentration factor is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:cpdRLC}~$c$ and it can be seen that, as with the RL and
simulated experiments, the presence of copper in the shell leads to a
low initial concentration which increases with frequency until around
$10$~kHz at which point the concentration factor plateaus.\\
The PTE for RL and RLC, no shell and full shell arrangements are
compared in figure~\ref{fig:cpdRLC}~$d$. It can be seen that the shell
increases the efficiency in both cases by a similar factor and that
the parallel resonant RLC arrangement gives a much greater efficiency
than using the simpler RL circuitary. \\

% Non ideal behaviour \\
For the constructed shells used in these experiments, their $R_2/R_1$
ratio was $(4.0\pm0.2)$ and from the theoretical TO work, it was
predicted that the field should be concentrated in the perfect shell
by the same ratio. The greatest concentration of field we observed was
$C_{Full} = (3.0\pm0.1)$ in the AC RL case. This concentration is
still well below the expected theoretical concentration factor of $C = (4.0
\pm 0.2)$ and likely explained by our approach to approximating the
perfect TO designed anisotropic shell to a discretized version
comprised of sections of high and low permeability.  In both static
and oscillating fields, experimentally and in simulations, we found
that $36$ MuMetal sheets performed better than $18$ MuMetal sheets
which suggests that finer discretization of the proposed shells gives
concentrations closer to the theoretical value. Furthermore, in the
static field experiments, only air was used to approximate the zero
relative angular permeability. Air has a permeability of $\mu_r
\approx 1$, which although is far less than the MuMetal's $\mu_r =
55,000-75,000 $, is likely still a poor approximation. This can be
seen by the increase in performance in the oscillating external field
experiments where copper sheets are introduced in order to effectively
screen out angular field density by the production of Eddy
currents. \\
Previous work by Pratt et. al.\cite{} included the exploration of
MuMetal and superconducting shells for concentrating static magnetic
fields. This work quoted a concentration factor of XXX at T<Tc and XXX
at T>Tc.\\

So far we have assumed the inductance of the solenoid
was independent of the shell surrounding it. Here we shall reexplore
some results without this assumption. \\ The resonant condition of a
series RLC circuit (figure~\ref{fig:WPT} $c$)
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \label{eqn:RLC}
%%   \omega = 1/\sqrt{LC},
%% \end{equation}
allows the calculation of effective inductance $L$ using the known
capacitance and found resonance frequency.  The inductance of the bare
coil or when surrounded by a copper only shell was $(1.02\pm0.02)$~mH
whilst the coil surrounded by the full shell was found to be
$(1.25\pm0.01)$~mH.  This increase in inductance can be understood by
the high permeability MuMetal in the shell being located near to the
coil, which increases the relative permeability of space in the
vicinity of the coil. A change in inductance will effect the power
transfer efficiency as described by XXX equation~\ref{eqn:eta}.  The
use of a resonant parallel RLC setup within the receiving circuit can
counteract this loss of power transfer as the optimum load resistance
in this case does not depend as strongly on the inductance value, but
rather on internal resistances of the components.\\

Due to the sharp drop off of power transfer with distance, the
greatest PTE found was $1.01\%$ XeX at a seperation of $48.7$~mm with
both the transmitting and receiving coil surrounded by a concentrating
shell. The reason for this poor efficiency is largely due to the
non-ideal real resistive component of the transmitting coil...

EXTENSIONS \\
0) For further understanding we would need to look at more frequencies
and expecially at much higher freqs. A selection of different dipoles
would also be beneficial to ensure that frequency dependence is not
linked to non-ideal dipole.\\

0) Perhaps another circuit could be designed that works more similarly
to an RLC? Could propose one however experimentation has not been
performed.\\

0) Could a more complicated and directional shell be designed for
power transfer?\\
