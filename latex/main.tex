XXPREVIOUSXX
A device capable of uniformly concentrating a magnetic fields inside of
a free space cavity will increase the efficiency of many magnetic
devices and sensors.  This project shall look at a proposed design for
a magnetic field concentrator informed by the transformation optic
technique. A metamaterial shell comprised of high and low permeability
sections alternating in the angular direction has been shown to
approximate the designed concentrator\cite{N2014}. The ability of the shell acting
as a concentrator will be explored in various regimes with a specific
focus on improving efficiency of wireless power transmission.

\section{Introduction}
%% - Motivation and overview brief description of power transfer problem

The manipulation of magnetic fields is a critical tool for many modern
technologies. Magnetic devices often have efficiencies dependent on
the strength of interaction with an external magnetic field. Examples
include energy harvesting from magnetic fields~\cite{HARVESTING} to
brain activity scans by locating small magnetic
gradients~\cite{BRAIN}. These devices may have increased efficiency by
concentrating the desired magnetic field within the area of sensing or
harvesting. \\ Magnetic fields may be described by Maxwell's
equations~\cite{MAXWELL} and are guided by materials due to their
optical properties, such as permitivity and permeability~\cite{OPTICAL
  PROPERITES}. Fermat's principle of least time allowed the design
of many optical devices using geometrical lenses~\cite{FERMAT},
however, with the maturation of fabrication techniques, many materials
may be produced with exotic anisotropic optical properties~\cite{META}
prompting the development of transformation optics (TO) --- a modern
approach to optical device design.\\ Here we describe one such TO
designed device; The magnetic concentrator~\cite{PRATT}, with a particular focus
on its efficacy in wireless power transmission. \\

    transformation $A$ is applied to guide the ray along a desired
    path. c) A material (blue) is insterted into the untransformed
    space with corresponding permeability and permitivity which mimics
    the spatial coordinate transform $A$ for the ray. }
  \label{fig:TO}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Transformation Optics and Metamaterials}
TO informed the design of many new devices such as perfect
lenses~\cite{}, magenetic-hoses~\cite{}, -cloaks~\cite{},
-rotators~\cite{}, -blackholes~\cite{}, and -concentrators~\cite{}. It
can be shown that due to the form invariance of Maxwell's equations, a
spatial coordinate transform is equivalent to the insertion of a
material with specific permeabilities and permitivities. This is shown
conceptually by the three steps of the schematic shown in
figure~\ref{fig:TO}. First a ray is considered in free cartesian space
in panel $a$, which due to Fermat's principle of least time will be
following the horizontal spatial grid lines.  The space is then
transformed arbitrarily in panel $b$ so that the ray adopts the
desired path for the final device. The transformation required, $A$,
to morph the ray now informs the optical properties for the specific
inserted material of panel $c$, which is once again located in
untransformed space.\\ The form invariance of Faraday's law is
described by the equivalent expressions

\begin{equation}
  \label{ME1}
  \nabla'\times \textbf{E'} = -jw[\mu_0]\textbf{H'}
  ~~~~~~~~and~~~~~~~~
  \nabla\times \textbf{E} = -jw[\mu']\textbf{H},
\end{equation}

where the first is expressed in transformed coordinate space $x'(x, y,
z), y'(x, y, z), z'(x, y, z)$ and free space permeability $[\mu_0]$,
whilst the second is expressed in untransformed cartesian space $x, y,
z$ but with some space dependent permeability $[\mu']$. Similar
equivalent expressions exist for the other Maxwell equations but with
some non-free permittivity $[\epsilon']$.\\
The required permeability and permittivity is found by,

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:J}
  \mu'=\frac{A\mu_0 A^T}{|A|}
  ~~~~~~~~and~~~~~~~~
  \epsilon'=\frac{A\epsilon_0 A^T}{|A|}
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the Jacobian matrix describing the transformation of
coordinate systems (e.g. between panel $a$ and panel $b$ in
figure~\ref{fig:TO}). \\
The resulting calculated optical properties may be anisotropic, have
arbitrary magnitude and even be negative~\cite{}. As bulk materials rarely, if
ever, show these properties, optical metamaterials are often
required~\cite{META3}. \\
Metamaterials are often comprised of repeating units whose dimensions
are much smaller than the wavelength of the interacting
radiation~\cite{META2}. The individual units may have specific
geometery, orientation and optical properties to selectively interact
with incident waves so that the net effect of the material mimics a bulk
substance with different optical properties than its substituent
parts.\\

\subsection{Magnetic Concentrator}
As described above, a device capable of magnetic field concentration
can increase the efficiency of sensors and energy harvesters.
Utilising TO we may design an optimal field concentrator which fulfils
the criteria: All magnetic field within a region $A$ is confined to
region $B$ where $B$ is free space only. A possible geometry for this
device that has cylindrical symmetry is shown in
XfXfigure~\ref{fig:shell}. A ray diagram
is shown in XfXfigure~\ref{fig:shell_TO} for free space with no
inserted material. Two coordinate transforms are now applied: First
the region $\rho < R_2 - \eta$ is radially and linearly compressed to
the region $\rho < R_1$; Second, to ensure the continuity of our
transformed space, a high ($k^{th}$) order polynomial radial expansion
of $R_2 - \eta < \rho < R_2$ to the region $R_1 < \rho < R_2$ is
made. These transformations are described by the coordinate
transformations,

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:transform}
  \begin{split}
\rho' = \frac{R_1}{R_2-\xi}\rho,~~~~~~~~\rho'\in[0,~R_2-\xi)~~\\
\rho' = R_2^{1-k}\rho^k~~~~~~~~~\rho'\in[R_2-\xi,~R_2).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

By symmetry we see that $\theta$ and $z$ remain unchanged through the
two transformations. The corresponding Jacobians may be found for
these transformations and using equation~\ref{eqn:J}, the
permeabilities of the required inserted material may be found to be

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:mat}
  \begin{split}
 \mu' = \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&(\frac{R_2-\xi}{R_1})^2\end{pmatrix}~~~~~~~~~~~~~\rho'\in[0,~R_1)~~\\
~~~~~~\mu' = \begin{pmatrix}k&0&0\\0&1/k&0\\0&0&\frac{1}{k}(\frac{\rho'}{R_2})^{2/k-2}\end{pmatrix}~~~~~\rho'\in[R_1,~R_2)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Taking the limit $\eta \rightarrow 0$ in order to concentrate all of
the field within $A$ into $B$, and matching the boundary conditions at
$R_2-\eta$ and at $R1$, we find that $k \rightarrow \infty$. From this
we find that the required permeability within $B$ is satisfied by free
space whilst a material with radial permeability $\mu_\rho \rightarrow
\infty$ and angular permeability $\mu_\theta \rightarrow 0$ is
required for region $A$. The $z$ components of permeability is ignored
as we assume it to be invariant if the cyclindrical shell is
significantly extended in the $z$ direction.\\
To satisfy this highly anisotropic condition, an exploration of
metamaterials is required. A possible discretized shell construction
is proposed~\cite{PRATT} where the high radial permeability is
provided by ferromagnetic materials whilst the angular permeability is
shielded by superconducting material. Materials such as MuMetal, have
relative permeabilities of up to XvX~\cite{MUMETAL} and ideal
superconductors in their Meissner state will exclude all magenetic
fields from within their interior giving a relative permeability of
$0$~\cite{Meissner}.  These two materials may be arranged in
alternating angular sheets, as seen in figure~\ref{fig:shell}, to
approximate the conditions proposed by TO design. \\
XeX discuss where this concentration originates? \\
In an external static uniform magnetic field, the ideal shell will
increase the field within region $B$ by a factor of
$R_2/R_1$. Similarly if a dipole with magnetic moment $m$ is present
at the origin and surrounded by the magnetic concentrator shell, then
the field outside of the shell will be increased by a factor of
$R_2/R_1$. Therefore for an observer at $\rho > R_2$ it will appear
that a dipole with magnetic moment $m\cdot R_2/R_1$ is present at the
origin.\\

(Comparison to other conc. techniques:
It is known that ferromagnetic materials concentrate magnetic fields
within their bulk~\cite{ferro} however, concentration of the field
into a free space cavity may be required.)

  \caption{Wireless power transmission by inductive coupling is
    proportional to $r^{-6}$. A concentrating shell increases this power
    transfer by $(R_2/R_1)^2$ but at the cost of less free space, $x$,

    shell provides an improvement over bare dipoles for a given free
    space distance, $x$. LHS: The arrangement of two dipoles (boxes)

    plots for these two arrangements when the shell has $R_2 = 40$~mm,
    $R_1 = 10$~mm.}\label{fig:d_motiv}
\end{figure}

The ability to transfer power between devices that are not connected
by wires is useful in many settings: for convenince, e.g. mobile
phones; for safety, e.g. implanted medical devices; or for
practicallity, e.g. satellites. We shall focus on near field power
transmission by the use of inductive coupling. Inductive coupling
transfers power between two coils of wire (two inductors) by an oscillating magnetic
field as seen in figure~\ref{fig:WPT}~$a$. The transmitting coil is
supplied with an alternating current, which by Ampere's law creates an
oscillating magnetic field. The receiving coil is placed within this
magnetic field, so that a current is induced as described by Faraday's
law. This strategy for power transfer is highly sensitive to
distance as the magnetic field of a dipole drops off with distance
cubed, $r^{-3}$, therefore the power is proportional to
$r^{-6}$.  The overall efficiency therefore suffers with distance as
the non-ideal resistive losses in the primary coil remain (relatively)
constant with distance. To somewhat counteract this sharp drop off of
efficiency with distance, concentrating shells may be used to magnify
the transmitted field and locally concentrate the field around the
receiving solenoid. The concentrating shell is larger than the coil by necessity 
however the presence of
a shell is always advantageous when the free space distance between
the power transmitting and power receiving device is greater than $k$,
where
\begin{equation}
k = \frac{R_2}{\sqrt[3]{R}-1}
\end{equation}
and $R$ is the ratio $R_2/R_1$. This arrangement and the critical
distance $k$ is shown in figure~\ref{fig:d_motiv}.\\

\end{figure}

\subsection{Construction of shell}
$0.15$~mm MuMetal (MSFHP from Thorlabs) and $0.3$~mm copper were cut
into $21$~mm by $30$~mm rectangular sheets.  Plastic supports for
holding $36$ sheets of either MuMetal or copper were 3D printed to
produce the shells seen in figure~\ref{fig:shells}. The inner radius
$R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$ were $7$ and $21$~mm respectively to give
an $R_2/R_1$ ratio of 4. The ``full shell'' contains $36$ sheets of
alternating copper and MuMetal, whilst the ``No shell'' scenario
contains no metal. \\

\subsection{DC Magnetic Fields}
Helmholtz coils (figure~\ref{fig:shells}) were powered by a constant
DC current to create a uniform magnetic field, $B$, within their
center described by
\begin{equation}
  B = \frac{8}{5\sqrt{5}}\frac{\mu_0 nI}{R},
  \label{eqn:helm}
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the radius of the coils, $I$ is the current supplied to
the coils, and $n$ is the number of turns of wire.  A Hall probe
placed at the center of the Helmholtz coils will have a Hall voltage
induced which is proportional to the magnetic field. Once calibrated
the Hall probe can be used to measure the absolute value of the
magnetic field present. A concentrating shell may now be placed around
at the center of the Helmholtz coils and the Hall probe placed within
the $R_1$ section of the shells to explore field concentration.

%%  This equation follows directly from the Biot-Savart law
%% \cite{XXX} and the relative geometry of the coils as seen in
%% figure~\ref{fig:helm}. From equation~\ref{eqn:helm} it can be seen that
%% the magnetic field should increase linearly with supplied
%% current. Using the Hall probe we ensured this was the case and found
%% the relationship of current supplied to magnetic field produced for
%% our paticular Helmholtz arrangement.\\ Now, with the capability to
%% produce known external magnetic fields, the described field
%% concentrating shells may be placed within this field and the Hall
%% probe may be placed within their inner radius to measure concentrated
%% field.

\subsection{AC characterization}

Use of solenoid, limitations due to pick up.\\
Due to the induced voltage across the inductor being small and
background noise being high, a lock-in amplifier was used to select
only the desired signal frequency. This substantially reduced noise in
our readings allowing higher frequency and lower magnetic field
strength experiments.\\

\subsection{Power Transfer}
Power transfer experiments measure power dropped across a load
resistor in a receiving circuit versus power lost in the transmitting
circuit's inductor. The receiving circuit, seen in
figure~\ref{fig:WPT}, has multiple arrangements to optimise power
transfer, the simplest of which is the load resistor in series with
the receiving inductor forming an RL circuit. If at the operating
frequency, $\omega$, the non-ideal real resistances of the coil, is
assumed to be $r_2 << \omega L$, then the optimal load resistance for
power transfer is found as,
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  V_s = I_s (j\omega L_2 + R),  \\
  P_s = |I_s|^2R = \frac{V_s^2R}{\omega^2L_2^2 + R^2},
  \label{eqn:RL-max}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
and by differentiating, we find a maxima occurs in $P_s$ occurs at
\begin{equation}
  R = \omega L_2.
\end{equation}
The EMF induced in the receiving coil of a coupled inductance system may be found by Faraday's law,
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon = -\frac{d\phi_{21}}{dt},
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{21}$ is the magnetic flux through coil 2 due
to the current of coil 1.  By defining a mutual inductance between two
coils as,
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{equation}
  M = \frac{\phi_{21}}{I_1},
\end{equation}
we find the equivalent expression for Faraday's law,
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon = -M\frac{dI_{1}}{dt}.
  \label{eqn:M}
\end{equation}
If the current in coil 1 is alternating sinuisoidally, then the
maximum EMF induced in coil 2 will be $M I_1 \omega$. Changes in mutual
inductance for different shell constructions is a useful metric for
field concentration as it is proportional to the magnetic flux present
in coil 2. It may also be readily calculated if current in coil one is
known and the voltage across the load resistance in circuit 2 is
measured when $R = \omega L$ as,
\begin{equation}
  V_s = \frac{MI_1\omega}{\sqrt{2}}.
  \label{eqn:MVs}
\end{equation}

Parallel RLC coupled to coil can be considered as
figure~\ref{fig:RLC-eqcirc}.  The voltage across $R_{load}$ is equal
to,
$$ V_s = j\omega MI_p - j\omega L_sI_s.$$
$I_s$ can be found by,
$$ I_s = j\omega MI_p / z_s $$
where $z_s$ is the total impedance of circuit 2...
\begin{equation}
V_s = \frac{MR}{L_s}I_p.
\label{eqn:RLC-M}
\end{equation}
Therefore a plot of $V_s / R$ against $I_p$ will yield a gradient of
$M/L_s$ as seen in figure~\ref{fig:RLC-IvI}.  Furthermore, $M =
M(\omega)$ for shells with copper present, and so a plot of
$(M/L_s)/(M^0/L_s^0)$ gives the relative increase in $M/L_s$ with
frequency as seen in figure~\ref{fig:RLC-Mrel}.\\


To maximise power transfer an RLC circuit is constructed on the
receiving circuit. Ideally in an RLC circuit the complex impedance of
the inductance and capacitance cancel leaving only the load
resistance. Our inductance is set by the solenoid we chose to use and
so for exploring power transfer at various frequencies, a capacitance
can be found to satisfy the resonance condition. If inductance, $L$,
does not vary then capacitance, $C$, is easily found by,
\begin{equation}
  C = \frac{1}{w^2L}.
\end{equation}
However, we need not assume that inductance is constant. A series RLC
circuit can be constructed as seen in figure~\ref{fig:WPT}~$c$ to
ensure resonance is met. Resonance occurs in this circuit when $V_x$
is exactly in phase with $V_y$. In this case any imaginary impedances
are cancelled and only real resistance remains. \\ For maximal power
transfer a parallel RLC circuit is preferable however due to the
restraints of the experiement a non-ideal version must be made as seen
in figure~\ref{fig:WPT}~$b$. The resonant condition found by the
series RLC is a close approximation to this more complicated parallel
circuit. \\
To maximise power transfer in the series RLC case, a familiar idea of
impedance matching occurs, i.e. Power is maximised when the load
resistance is equal to any internal resistances of the
components~\cite{XXX}. As internal resistances are difficult to
measure and may depend on current XXX, this could also be found
experimentally by measuring voltage and current over the load
resistance whilst varying load resistance. \\ For the parallel RLC
case, a more complicated expression for optimal load resistance was
found which depends non trivially on a combination of internal
resistances. A model is proposed below, however, experimentally
locating the optimal resistances was chosen as measuring internal
resistances proved difficult and time consuming.\\

\end{figure}

Using Helmholtz coils powered in DC to create a static external
magnetic field (see Methods), we observed constant field concentration
factors within the $R_1$ cavity for various shell constructions. No
shell, 18 MuMetal, 36 MuMetal, 18 Copper and 18 MuMetal + 18 Copper
shells were used and their concentration factor with field may be seen
in figure~\ref{fig:DC_graph}, where concentration factor is defined as
(Internal Field)/(External Field). \\ It was found that the shell
contruction of 36 MuMetal thin sheets gave the optimum concentration
factor of $C = 2.38$ with minimal error ($0.1\%$) at higher field
strengths and a maximum error of $4.0\%$ at an external field of
$1.4$~G. This increase in error at low magnetic fields is due to
limited sensitivity of our Hall probe and current measurements over
the Helmholtz coils.\\ Similar error relationships are observed for
the other constructions. It should be noted that we assume the dipole
has been placed in the same position and orientation in all
experiments and so errors due to placement are excluded here.\\ It is
expected that the copper will have no effect on a static magnetic
field and this was confirmed by the $18$ copper shell displaying no
concentration of internal field.  This is due to copper having a
relative permeability similar to air, $\mu_r = 1.0$, and so negligible
field guiding properties. In the oscillating magnetic field regime
copper is expected to shield angular fields due to the production of
eddy currents. Only air-gaps are used to block the angular component
of a static magnetic field within our shells to simplify the
experimental set up, however superconducting sheets in a similar shell
have been shown to improve the concentration of static
fields~\cite{PRATT}.\\

Power is transferred from the primary circuit to a load resistor in
the secondary circuit as explained in Methods XXX. This may be simply
performed by placing a load resistor in parallel with the receiving
inductor $L_s$ forming an RL circuit as seen in XfX
figure~\ref{fig:WPT}. To maximise power transferred, the optimal load
resistance was matched to $R = \omega L$ (see Methods
equation~\ref{eqn:RL-max}). \\ Figure~\ref{fig:RL-R} shows the
relative PTE versus load resistance for various frequencies confirming
the expected optimum load resistance of $R = \omega L$. \\
Mutual inductances between the coils at a set distance of $59$~mm were
found by measuring the voltage across the load resistor in the
secondary RL circuit and the current driving the primary circuit. The
copper only, MuMetal only, and full copper plus MuMetal shells all
showed a concentrating effect by their relative increases in mutual
inductance between the two coils as shown in the LHS of
figure~\ref{fig:RL-F}. The full shell showed an increase of mutual inductance (magnetic field) by
a factor of $3.0\pm0.1$. The frequency
dependance on the relative increase in mutual inductance is shown on
the RHS of figure~\ref{fig:RL-F}. The two shell configurations
containing copper are shown to have concentrating effects dependant on
frequency. The concentrating effect rises steeply within the first
$10$~kHz and then plateaus for high frequencies.
This expected behaviour initially motivated the choice for copper sheets in the
shells for AC power transfer. At higher frequencies the perpendicular
component of alternating magnetic fields produce eddy currents within
the copper which, due to Lenz's law, oppose the change of field
direction and effectively increases the angular permeability of the
shell.  Supporting work done on COMSOL (figure~\ref{fig:COMSOL_CU})
shows a similar observed effect where 36 copper sheets increases the
concentration factor rapidly from $C = 1$ at $0$~Hz to $C = 1.5$ (2SF)
by $10$~kHz and then only a small further increase in efficacy at higher
frequencies.\\
Apart from errors due to instrument, measurement reading, and coil
placement, we observed noise due to stray magnetic fields inducing
pick-up within cables connecting the solenoid to the lock-in
amplifier. This source of noise is highly frequency dependent and is
at the same frequency as our desired signal, so could not be removed by
the use of a lock-in amplifier. To supress this noise careful cable
placement and shielding was installed. \\

Parallel RLC circuits are more fitting for optimising power
transfer~\cite{XXX} as explained in Methods. For the arrangement
described in figure~\ref{fig:WPT}$b$, a shell comprised of $18$
MuMetal and $18$ Copper sheets was explored. The optimal load
resistances were found experimentally by measuring power for a sweep
of resistances. An example of which is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:cpdRLC}$a$ for a field frequency of $30$~kHz.\\
From equation~\ref{eqn:RLC-M} the voltage measured across the load
resistor is proportional to the mutual inductance between the two
coils when the optimal load resistor is used and the resonance
condition for the RLC circuit is met. Figure~\ref{fig:cpdRLC}$b$
confirms this relationship and shows an increase of mutual inductance
when the full concentrating shell is present. The gradient was found
to be increased by a factor of $2.6 \pm 0.2$ corresponding to a field
concentration of the same factor if the inductance of $L_2$ is assumed
to remain constant. \\
The frequency dependance on concentration factor is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:cpdRLC}$c$ and it can be seen that, as with the RL and
simulated experiments, the presence of copper in the shell leads to a
low initial concentration which increases with frequency until around
$10$~kHz at which point the concentration factor plateaus.\\
The PTE for RL and RLC, no shell and full shell arrangements are
compared in figure~\ref{fig:cpdRLC}$d$. It can be seen that the shell
increases the efficiency in both cases by a similar factor and that
the parallel resonant RLC arrangement gives a much greater efficiency
than using the simpler RL circuitary. \\

% Non ideal behaviour \\
For the constructed shells used in these experiments, their $R_2/R_1$
ratio was $40 \pm 2$ mm. From the theoretical TO work, it is predicted
that the field should be concentrated by the perfect shell by
$R_2/R_1$. We found a range of concentrations for both static, $C =
2.25 - 2.38$ XeX and oscillating, $C = 2 - 3.1$ XeX, external fields
whose maximum concentration factors are still well below the expected
theoretical concentration factor of $4.0 \pm 0.2$. This is likely
explained by our approach to approximating the perfect TO designed
anisotropic shells with shells comprised of discrete sections of high
and low permeability.  In both static and oscillating fields, we found
that 36 MuMetal sheets performed better than 18 MuMetal sheets which
suggests that finer discretization of the proposed shells gives
concentrations closer to the theoretical value. In the static field
experiments, only air was used to approximate the zero relative
angular permeability. Air has a permeability of $\mu = 1$, which
although is far less than the MuMetal's $\mu = XXX$, is likely still a
poor approximation. This can be seen by the increase in performance in
the oscillating external field experiments where copper sheets are
introduced in order to effectively screen out angular field density by
the production of Eddy currents. Eddy current screening is
proportional to frequency of the oscillating field~\cite{XXX}, and
therefore, it can be seen that the concentration factor for shells
with copper present increase with frequency. \\

Eddy currents may be modelled as a wire loop perpendicular to an
oscillating magenetic field. A current is produced within the loop
which is proportional to frequency of the field and, due to Lenz's
law, flows in a direction to oppose the change in field density. The
induced current in the loop is
$$ I = \frac{A}{R}\omega (B - B'), $$
and the field produced by the current is,
$$ B' = -I \mu_0 r. $$
Combining these equations give,
$$ B' = \frac{\omega B}{1+\omega}, $$
which may be seen plotted with the COMSOL and experimental results for
a copper only shell.\\

angular field in the static case~\cite{XXX}... \\

For many results we have assumed that the inductance of the solenoid
was independent of the shell surrounding it. Here we shall reexplore
some results without this assumption. \\ The resonant condition of a
series RLC circuit,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:RLC}
  \omega = 1/\sqrt{LC},
\end{equation}
allows the calculation of effective inductance $L$ using the known
capacitance, $C$ and measured frequency peak,
$\omega$. Figure~\ref{fig:inductance} shows $\omega^{-1}$ against
$\sqrt{C}$ to find inductance $L$. The observed inductances for the
two shell configurations are not sensitive to frequency however, it
should be noted that the inductance of the coils used does have a
dependency on current. For the range of currents used in the series
RLC experiment, this change in inductance with current was negligible
compared with the observed change in inductances with different
surrounding shells. It was found that the inductance when surrounded
by the full shell is $1.25\pm0.01$~mH whilst the bare solenoid and the
copper only shell give an inductance of $1.02\pm0.02$~mH. This
increase in inductance could be understood by the fact that the high
permeability MuMetal in the shell is located near to the coil,
increasing the relative permeability of space in the vicinity of the
coil. From equation~\ref{eqn:eta} it can be seen that the effective
power concentration, $\eta$, for the RL circuit is dependent on both
field concentration and effective inductance of the solenoid and in
fact the increase in effective inductance reduces the increase in
power transfer. The use of a tuned RLC setup within the receiving
circuit can counteract this loss of power concentration with increased
inductance as the load resistance no longer needs to match $\omega L$,
as discussed in Methods.\\

Due to the sharp drop off of power transfer with distance, the
greatest PTE found was $1.01\%$ XeX at a seperation of $48.7$~mm with
both the transmitting and receiving coil surrounded by a concentrating
shell. The reason for this poor efficiency is largely due to the
non-ideal real resistive component of the transmitting coil.

0) For further understanding we would need to look at more frequencies
and expecially at much higher freqs. A selection of different dipoles
would also be beneficial to ensure that frequency dependence is not
linked to non-ideal dipole.\\

0) Perhaps another circuit could be designed that works more similarly
to an RLC? Could propose one however experimentation has not been
performed.\\

0) Could a more complicated and directional shell be designed for
power transfer?\\
