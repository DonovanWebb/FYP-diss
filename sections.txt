Abstract
- At the end! ~150 words (1/3-1/2 page)

Introduction
- Motivation and overview
- Wireless power transfer - lit review
- Maxwell equations
- Transformation optics at extension 
    - Metamaterial realization
    - lit review
- Back to power transfer and discussion on circuitary, RLC (could
  leave to methods?)
- Where this work fits in overall field

Methods
- Do not gloss over too many details
- Do discuss calibration of devices
- How to make shell
- Helmholtz and Hall probe(skip?)
- Circuitary for both DC, AC and power transfer.
- RLC parallel tuning

Results
- Key results only!
- Discuss observed trends
    - Concentration factor
    - Power transfer
- Discuss sources and magnitude of errors
- Simulations

Discussion
- Tee and Pi circuit analysis
- Models
- Overall trends matching simulation, analysis and Experimental
- Comparison with other published results
- Contextualize findings in light of other work

Conclusions
- At the end!
- What else could be explored
