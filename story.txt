### INTRO ###
0)  Wireless Power transfer - Maxwell equations explains the strong
fall off of effieciency with distance.

0)  Transformation optics is a powerful tool for designing arbitrary
field manipulation devices.
	- We have specifications for a device that concentrates
	  magnetic field in free space by an arbitrary factor while
	  maintaining the original characteristics of the field.
	- Using 'Metamaterial' to realise solution as highly
          anisotropic material needed.
	- optimal coupling between two shells is wanted. Can discuss
          here how this arrangement is better than two dipoles at x-2R
          distance apart.
	- Other uses for such a device
	  e.g - Safe strong magnet.
	      - Small field detection.
	      - Brain scan.
	      - magnetic memory devices if miniaturization possible.

0) For Power transfer we need two coupled dipoles. To efficiently
transfer power we may use an RLC arrangement (although discuss
alternative arrangements too).

0) Exploration of RLC coupled dipoles. Here describe the resonant
conditions and show our proposed circuitary. Introduce the Tee and Pi
equivalent circuits in order to perform complex analysis on the
circuit for a theoretical power transfer.
        - Discussion of sublte dependence on load resistance on power
          transfer due to not having a ideal RLC set up. This has not
          been found in literature so is an interesting developement.

### RESULTS ###
0) Testing the shell in various ways to characterize the physical
implementation of the theory. Many Transformation optic experiments
finish at simulation but real devices are quite different. Discuss
here the lack of SC material in DC case yet use of copper is available
in AC regime.

0) First simple DC characterisation to validate set up and see how
device works using strong external field. Also to compare with COMSOL
simulations.
        - Get our first concentration factor and using simple circuit.
        - Talk about the Hall probe and Helmholtz coil.
	- Internal dipole experiment with Hall probe at various
          distances?
	- Various shell set ups being explored and some comparison
          with values found in COMSOL.
	- A discussion on why we do not see behaviour described in
          transformation optics as we are discretizing the anistropic
          behaviour.

0)  AC experimentation and comparison with COMSOL modelling.
     |  - Simple set up first without RLC set up to ensure devices are
     |    correct.
     |	- Load resistance should equal internal resistances for
     |    optimum power transfer.
     |	- Frequency sweeps show interesting behaviour of device. Is
     |    this a break down of Mu metal or a limitation of non-ideal
     |    inductors/capacitors?

	- Show power loss of inductor dependence on frequency - can
          this be excluded in a clever way?

     |  - RLC circuit used and now show dependence on R load both in
     |    model and in real experiment.
     |	- Modelling fits okay in terms of behaviour but poorly gives
     |    actual observed measurement - is this due to non-ideality of
     |    components?
     |  - We show increase when shell is used and obtain concentration
     |    factors.
     |  - Maximum power transfer observed is 1% - well below expected
     |    value.
     |	- Discuss calculations of Mutual inductances and strong
     |    dependence on distance.

        - The role of a thin sheet of copper in the experiment is
          interesting - an effect is observed even at low frequencies
          where skin depth is not yet reached. This effect is also
          saturated early on suggesting that eddy currents effectively
          screen on much smaller thicknesses than initially
          anticipated. A model could be suggested.

### Extensions ###
0) For further understanding we would need to look at more frequencies
and expecially at much higher freqs. A selection of different dipoles
would also be beneficial to ensure that frequency dependence is not
linked to non-ideal dipole.

0) Perhaps another circuit could be designed that works more similarly
to an RLC? Could propose one however experimentation has not been
performed.

0) Could a more complicated and directional shell be designed for
power transfer?
